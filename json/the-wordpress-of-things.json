I was booked in for a short lightning talk slot on the design track and decided to share some of the experimentation I have been doing with WordPress and the <a href=\"https://www.spark.io/\">Spark Core</a>.</p>\n<p>The Spark Core is an Arduino-compatible, Wi-Fi enabled, cloud-powered development platform that makes creating internet-connected hardware a quick and simple. Most importantly it is open hardware and software &mdash; sharing the WordPress philosophy.</p>\n<p>My slides are below and I have also added a few of the GitHub links to various experimentations and tools mentioned&nbsp;throughout the talk.
