All these graphs follow a trend of low to high &ndash; ie the line keeps moving upwards. Think about life, it&rsquo;s full of climbing graphs:</p>\n<ul><li>Life expectancy &mdash; people are living longer, diagnosis and treatment of disease has improved</li>\n<li>Temperature &mdash; warmer temperatures should lead to more vitamin D!</li>\n<li>Wealth &mdash; we&rsquo;re all getting richer which means we have the money available to consume more &mdash; holidays, food, property, clothing, cars, gadgets, fuel</li>\n<li>Population &mdash; we find strength in numbers</li>\n<li>Profits &mdash; more sales, more money, more staff, more offices, more investment, bigger bonuses, higher salary</li>\n</ul><p>If everything is on the up, this can only be a good thing, right?</p>\n<p>The problem with this trend is that it&rsquo;s not sustainable. What goes up must come down. By striving to be always on the up, we are setting ourselves up for an inevitable down. There will be a point where this line starts falling again.</p>\n<p>Take population growth as an example. In the early stages of humans &lsquo;arriving&rsquo; on earth, the best way to ensure survival was in numbers. In the early stages, humans were just a tiny spec on the planet. We dug wells, harvested small areas of vegetation, channelled rivers, dug mines and used the resources around us to build shelter. The more we reproduced, the more resources we needed to sustain ourselves. We started to turn meadows into fields to grow food. We chopped down areas of forest and mined raw materials to build homes. Over time, fields have been concreted over to build airports, housing and cities. And here we sit at the crest of a peak!</p>\n<p>If we continue at our current rate of consumption, we are going to run out of land suitable for farming, land for building houses and vegetation to soak up carbon dioxide. But the problem is we can&rsquo;t put any more &lsquo;in&rsquo; and as a result we can&rsquo;t get any more &lsquo;out&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>So what should sustainability look like?</p>\n<p><strong>A straight line</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>Why not a circle?</em></p>\n<p>A circle in theory is the perfect image of <a title=\"Blog Action Day 09\" href=\"http://www.blogactionday.org/\">sustainability</a>. But, a circle assumes we can start again from the beginning. When we draw a circle, we are connecting one point to another, the end to the beginning. A straight line has a beginning and has the capacity to continue forever. In order for the line to stay straight, we must put in what we take out &mdash; this is truly sustainable.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"There is one graph that the world loves to see.

The article, written by <a title=\"Tim Jackson\" href=\"http://www.sd-commission.org.uk/pages/tim-jackson.html\">Tim Jackson</a> sets the tone for our Blog Action Day posts:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Every society clings to a myth by which it lives. Ours is the myth of economic growth. For the last five decades the pursuit of growth has been the single most important policy goal across the world. The global economy is almost five times the size it was half a century ago. If it continues to grow at the same rate, the economy will be 80 times that size by the year 2010.</p>\n<p>This extraordinary ramping up of the global economy has no historical precedent. It&rsquo;s totally at odds with our scientific knowledge of the finite resource base and the fragile ecology we depend on for survival. And it has already been accompanied by the degradation of an estimated 60% of the world&rsquo;s ecosystems.</p>\n<p>For the most part, we avoid the stark reality of these numbers. The default assumption is that &mdash; financial crisis aside &mdash; growth will continue indefinitely. Not just for the poorest countries where a better quality of life is undeniably needed, but even for the richest nations where the cornucopia of material wealth adds little to happiness and is beginning to threaten the foundations of our well-being.</p>\n<p>The reasons for this collective blindness are easy enough to find. The modern economy is structurally reliant on economic growth for its stability. When growth falters &mdash; as it has done recently &mdash; politicians panic. Businesses struggle to survive. People loose their jobs and sometimes their homes. A spiral of recession looms. Questioning growth is deemed to be the act of lunatics, idealists and revolutionaries.</p>\n<p>But question it we must. The myth of growth has failed us. It has failed the two billion people who still live on less that $2 a day. It has failed the fragile ecological systems we depend on for survival. It has failed spectacularly, in its own terms, to provide economic stability and secure people&rsquo;s livelihoods.</p>\n<p>Today we find ourselves faced with the imminent end of the era of cheap oil; the prospect (beyond the recent bubble) of steadily rising commodity prices; the degradation of forests, lakes and soils; conflicts over land use, water quality and fishing rights; and the momentous challenge of stabilizing concentrations of carbon in the global atmosphere. And we face these tasks with an economy that is fundamentally broken, in desperate need of renewal&hellip;</p></blockquote>\n<p>A message this clear needs little summary. Solving these issues must become our priority.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Today, bloggers across the globe are writing about one topic: climate change.

I am thinking of buying a <a title=\"mmmm Mac Pro\" href=\"http://www.apple.com/macpro/\">Mac Pro</a> to use as my main machine and to replace the Linux server we currently have setup in the corner of the office. If the Mac Pro is going to replace the Linux box it needs to provide us with a web server (as well as file sharing, media sharing etc) and the web server needs to be accessible over the local network to all other machines in the office. Our Linux box is serving us well but I see an opportunity to merge two computers into one; making for a greener office and hopefully it will be a little easier to manage (I am far more comfortable in OS X than <a title=\"ClarkConnect - Linux Distro\" href=\"http://www.clarkconnect.com/\">ClarkConnect</a>). We call our Linux machine &ldquo;tux&rdquo;, it has its own DNS server that means we can access it over the network at tux.lan. It works well but one of my issues with it has been having to install websites into sub-directories. For example our local <a title=\"toggle - handmade gadget cases\" href=\"http://www.toggle.uk.com\">toggle</a> website sits at tux.lan/toggle.uk.com. Because our local sites do not live in a root web folder our local sites can have a number of differences compared to the live sites, these differences mean we have to be careful when deploying changes.</p>\n<p>I have spent today looking at ways I can use the standard install of OS X to act as a web server. Although OS X comes with Apache built in, one of the simplest ways to get PHP, MySQL and Apache is to use <a title=\"Mac, Apache, PHP, MySQL\" href=\"http://www.mamp.info/\">MAMP</a>. I have been using MAMP for a number of years and love the fact it is expendable and not deeply integrated into the system. If I want to change PHP version I can do so at the touch of a button and if it goes wrong I can copy a new version over the top. So how do we share MAMP over the local network with nice (virtual hostey) URLs like: toggle.uk.com.dev?</p>\n<h3>You Will Need:</h3>\n<p>I am going to assume you have a few things in place:</p>\n<ol><li>You are running OS X 10.5+</li>\n<li>Your Mac has a fixed IP address on your local network (e.g. 192.168.0.10)</li>\n<li>You have installed MAMP and your document root is your OS X sites folder</li>\n<li>You can use Terminal</li>\n</ol><p>The next couple of steps were modified from <a title=\"A smarter MAMP\" href=\"http://postpostmodern.com/instructional/a-smarter-mamp/\">postpostmodern.com</a>, which is the closest tutorial I could find to what I was trying to achieve. The main difference here is that we want this to work across the local network and not just on the one local machine.</p>\n<h3>BIND &ndash; The Hidden OS X DNS Server</h3>\n<p>A DNS server converts a name (<a title=\"Google\" href=\"http://www.google.com\">google.com</a>) to an IP address (<a title=\"Google's IP\" href=\"http://74.125.45.100/\">74.125.45.100</a>) &ndash; it basically means we do not have to remember IP addresses for the sites we want to visit. We need to enable the DNS server on our OSX machine so when we enter a local URL (toggle.uk.com.dev) it looks for the website on the local server (which lives at 192.168.0.10). I am not a DNS expert but following these steps did the trick for me.</p>\n<h4>Setup rndc</h4>\n<p>Open up terminal and get into root:<code> sudo -s</code><br>\nGenerate the config file for &lsquo;rndc&rsquo;:<code> rndc-confgen &gt; /etc/rndc.conf<br></code>Copy a key to the newly created file:<code> head -n 6 /etc/rndc.conf &gt; /etc/rndc.key</code></p>\n<h4>Create your DNS Zone File</h4>\n<p>DNS zones are created via files in /var/named. Create a new file in there called dev.zone and fill it with this:</p>\n<pre><code>;\r\n; BIND data file for dev sites\r\n;\r\n$TTL 604800\r\n@ IN SOA dev. root.dev. (\r\n2008101920 ; Serial\r\n604800 ; Refresh\r\n86400 ; Retry\r\n2419200 ; Expire\r\n604800 ) ; Negative Cache TTL\r\n;\r\n@ IN NS dev.\r\n@ IN A 192.168.0.10\r\n*.dev. 14400 IN A 192.168.0.10\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>You will have to replace the IP address (192.168.0.10) with the IP address of your Mac on the local network, remember this should be a fixed IP to ensure it keeps working.</p>\n<h4>Configure named.conf</h4>\n<p>Open /etc/named.conf. The first thing you want to do here is to show named where to get its DNS info (for the rest of the internet), it is probably best to use the <a title=\"Super Duper DNS\" href=\"http://www.opendns.com/\">OpenDNS</a> servers. Scroll through this file until you see an options section with the line: directory &ldquo;/var/named&rdquo;; &ndash; just after this paste the following code:</p>\n<pre><code>forwarders {\r\n    208.67.222.222;\r\n    208.67.220.220;\r\n};\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next we need to add a reference to the zone file we created a minute ago. There is a localhost section already in /etc/named.conf, find it and post the following code below it:</p>\n<pre><code>zone \"dev\" IN {\r\n    type master;\r\n    file \"dev.zone\";\r\n};\r\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Getting DNS to start with your Mac</h4>\n<p>Open the LaunchDaemon plist file (/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.isc.named.plist) and look for the first instance of the word &lsquo;true&rsquo; and change it to &lsquo;false&rsquo;. It should appear just under the word &lsquo;disabled&rsquo;. You can now load it using the following terminal command:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.isc.named.plist</code></pre>\n<p>The DNS server should now be up and running on your machine, you will need to tell other machines on your network and the Mac itself to look at this IP address for DNS. In system preferences -&gt; network -&gt; add &lsquo;127.0.0.1&rsquo; to the list of DNS servers (for the server itself) and for other machines on the network add &lsquo;192.168.0.10&rsquo; to the list of DNS servers. The other machines on the network will now look to this IP address when you first type in a URL into your browser.</p>\n<h3>Setup MAMP</h3>\n<p>Now that the DNS stuff is out of the way, it&rsquo;s just a matter of setting that magic directive in your Apache conf file. The directive is called <a href=\"http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_vhost_alias.html\">VirtualDocumentRoot</a>. You need to navigate to the MAMP folder (/Applications/MAMP/conf/apache) and open up httpd.conf in a text editor of your choice. Search the file for &ldquo;Virtual hosts&rdquo; and uncomment the line just below:</p>\n<pre><code>Include /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf</code></pre>\n<p>Next open the httpd-vhost.conf file in the extra folder, scroll to the very bottom of the file and add the following code:</p>\n<pre><code>NameVirtualHost 192.168.0.10\r\n\r\n&lt;VirtualHost 192.168.0.10&gt;\r\n    VirtualDocumentRoot /Users/YOURUSERNAME/Sites/%-2+/\r\n&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The VirtualDocumentRoot is an interpolated path for finding your sites. &lsquo;%-2+&rsquo; means everything before the .dev. So: example.dev would load files from /Users/YOURUSERNAME/Sites/example/. If MAMP was running you should now re-start Apache and visiting example.dev in your browser should bring up a 404 (unless of course you have a folder called example in your sites folder). Did it work?</p>\n<h3>Hitting Problems</h3>\n<p>I had a number of issues getting this to work across the network and during that time I was running quite a few commands to get rndc to restart without having to reboot my machine every time I made a change. At first I could not get rndc to listen to any of my commands, searching Google once more I found a handy <a title=\"DNS Problem - rndc: connect failed: connection refused \" href=\"http://www.daniweb.com/forums/post226617-12.html\">forum tip</a> suggesting the issue might be related to port numbers. I suggest you follow these few extra steps to resolve the issue:</p>\n<p>Open up terminal and run the following: <code>sudo nano /etc/rndc.conf</code> &ndash; look for the options at the top of the file and make sure the default port is set to 54. Save (ctrl-x, Y, Enter) and you should now be able to use the the command line to interface with rndc.</p>\n<h3>Useful Commands</h3>\n<p>Whilst working through the steps above I came across a number of handy command line tools that you might find useful too:</p>\n<p><code>nslookup dev</code> : nslookup will interactively find MX and other records. I used this on network machines to see if they correctly identified the Mac as the .dev server. <code>dscacheutil -flushcache</code> : OSX has a tendency to cache DNS, this flushes the cache so you can check your changes. <code>rndc reload</code> : This reloaded any changes I made to my DNS zone files.</p>\n<p>So that brings me to the end of this tutorial, having successfully tested this on my Mac laptop I am now one step closer to making a decision about the Mac Pro. How did you get on?</p>\n<p>p.s. If you follow these steps and consequently have issues with PHP&rsquo;s <code>$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']</code> variable. You might wish to follow the advice <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=26052#c27\" rel=\"external nofollow\">here</a>. Apache does not play well with document roots and virtual hosts.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Use MAMP as a local development server for your home or office network with clean .dev URLs for your local sites.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[11],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/71"}],"collection":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=71"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/71/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1496,"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/71/revisions/1496"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=71"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=71"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=71"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"author":[{"id":1,"name":"scottsweb","url":"","description":"","link":"https://api.scott.ee/journal/author/scottsweb/","slug":"scottsweb","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1"}],"collection":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/users"}]}}],"wp:term":[[{"id":11,"link":"https://api.scott.ee/journal/category/wordpress/","name":"WordPress","slug":"wordpress","taxonomy":"category","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/categories/11"}],"collection":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/categories"}],"about":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/taxonomies/category"}],"wp:post_type":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?categories=11"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}}],[]]}},{"id":24,"date":"2008-08-01T10:11:26","date_gmt":"2008-08-01T10:11:26","guid":{"rendered":"http://scott.cloudcontrol.me/?p=24"},"modified":"2018-11-18T21:30:50","modified_gmt":"2018-11-18T21:30:50","slug":"see-whats-on-with-watson","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https://api.scott.ee/journal/see-whats-on-with-watson/","title":{"rendered":"See &#8220;What&#8217;s on&#8221; with Watson!"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p class=\"intro\">At <a title=\"toggle design\" href=\"http://www.toggle.uk.com\">toggle</a> we are always on the look our for ways we can reduce our impact on the environment.

For now we have to choose reliability over sustainability. All is not lost though, last month we purchased a very cool device called Watson, Watson is described as a &ldquo;Home (or Office) energy monitor&rdquo; and that is exactly what it does.</p>\n<p>It may look a little bit like a coffee table that glows pretty colours but Watson is an extremely useful and clever device that monitors (and logs to your PC or Mac) your energy usage. It&rsquo;s actually much smaller than it looks in the photo and has been sitting quietly in the office for last month recording our electricity usage. Before Watson we had no idea how much electricity we used or how much it was costing. The day it arrived we turned off every possible appliance we could get to and then slowly introduced each one, logging how much energy they use. By that evening we had already found two appliances that were consuming about 140W continuously (on standby) and that are now switched off at the wall when not in use. That alone should save us about &pound;170 a year!</p>\n<p>We now have an idea of how much electricity our local test server is consuming and which lights are best to turn on first. Each week we are looking at our logged data to see what days are the worst offenders and trying to figure what devices caused it&hellip; we are already up &pound;2 on last week!</p>\n<p>We may not have green hosting (yet) but the toggle office is no longer humming all day (and night).</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"It may look a little bit like a coffee table that glows pretty colours but Watson is an extremely useful and clever device that monitors (and logs to your PC or Mac) your energy usage.
