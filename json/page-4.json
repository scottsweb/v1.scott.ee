Every digital click creates a trail of information: analytics tracking, server logs, browsing history, search history, previous purchases and recommendations. Add this to the content we choose to share: photos, articles, blogs, emails, instant messages, texts, Facebook Likes, Tweets, Diggs, Stumbles etc etc and the result is a vast quantity of data being stored throughout the world, every second of every day.</p>\n<blockquote><p>By 2013 the quantity of information on the Internet will double roughly every 72 hours.<br>\n&mdash; <a title=\"The attention age is here\" href=\"http://aaronendre.com/2009/10/26/step-aside-information-age-the-attention-age-is-here/\">Aaron Endre</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>This will inevitably lead us to a couple of quite serious problems. The first is how we choose, find or filter the content we consume and the second is the environmental impact of storing, transferring and keeping all this data.</p>\n<h3>Content Consumption</h3>\n<p>You have to wonder if the solution to this will be generating less content or finding new ways to filter it. Google are in a good position with search but there are many situations where search does not make sense. For instance on Twitter where you follow people who interest you but you may not always be interested in everything being said. This is the same for RSS applications. I subscribe to a large number of blogs and more often than not I am only interested in a just few of the posts each day. I have to scan through 100&rsquo;s of articles to find the ones that really interest me.</p>\n<p>Largely this problem can be solved with smarter technology. Personalised search, bookmarks and social graphs can be used to generate some very powerful tools. It&rsquo;s more likely we will build these tools and continue to generate obscene amounts of content. But should we?</p>\n<h3>The Green Issue</h3>\n<p>We (<a title=\"toggle - handmade gadget cases\" href=\"http://www.toggle.uk.com\">toggle</a>) were recently asked to consider joining a list of <a title=\"Green agencies on Re-nourish\" href=\"http://www.re-nourish.com/?l=casestudies_greendesign\">green agencies</a> on <a title=\"Re-think design to be greener and sustainable\" href=\"http://www.re-nourish.com/\">Re-nourish</a>. While we would love to be listed, in light of the above, can we really be a green company? We have over 8 terrabytes of storage space in the toggle office (not all of its used). All of our data is backed up here and across the internet to distant corners of the globe. <a title=\"toggle on twitter\" href=\"http://twitter.com/toggle\">We tweet</a>, <a title=\"toggle journal\" href=\"http://www.toggle.uk.com/blog/\">we blog</a> and <a title=\"toggle on flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/toggle\">we share photos</a>. We have handfuls of accounts across different web services. Each of these services generate more data for both us and our clients. Our server gets backed up in three different places and each and every web site we host gets larger month after month; using more bandwidth, more storage and more electricity.</p>\n<p>How can we start to improve this?</p>\n<h4>Website Performance</h4>\n<p>Last week we began a new phase of website performance testing. We are now keeping a closer eye on ping times, load times and uptime&rsquo;s of our sites and server. On top of this we are investigating WordPress and website performance gains. We have managed to decrease the load time of this site by around 3 seconds for the homepage and we will continue to make improvements on this over the coming month. Improved <a title=\"Google talk website performance (video)\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpMfx_Zie2g\">website performance</a> not only reduces the strain on bandwidth, storage and electricity, it also increases conversions, user satisfaction and search engine performance. It&rsquo;s certainly a worthy endeavour.</p>\n<h4>Say Less</h4>\n<p>When you say less, you get noticed more. There are a couple of blogs that I subscribe to that only post a handful of articles each year. The strange thing is I nearly always read them from start to finish. When they do arrive in my RSS reader it&rsquo;s a real treat. The quality of the content is far more important than the quantity.</p>\n<p>There are many blogs (that I will not name) that are quite obviously writing pointless articles aimed at search engine performance and riding current trends. These articles are getting easier to spot and are appearing more frequently. At some point the value of the things we share will have to be put under scrutiny (a completely separate issue).</p>\n<h4>Account Control</h4>\n<p>How many different usernames and passwords do you have? Which services are they for and are they necessary? We have always kept a list of the accounts we have. The list is useful to remember the variations of our username (toggle, toggleuk, togglelabs etc). The list has become even more useful though as we are now going to start closing any account that has not been used for a year. This should help curb the amount digital waste coming from toggle HQ and stop it extending into infinity. In short; close your old accounts. You remember that <a title=\"MySpace\" href=\"http://www.myspace.com/\">MySpace profile</a> and <a title=\"Friend Reunited\" href=\"http://www.friendsreunited.com/\">Friends Reunited account</a>? Delete them!</p>\n<p>So, I&rsquo;m about to hit &ldquo;publish&rdquo; and I can&rsquo;t help but feel a little more digitally plump from the impending avalanche that is about be sent your way&hellip; and it&rsquo;s not like the delete key can save us now with its over forgiving, trash can, revision saving, are you sure? nature.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"There were 5 exabytes of information created between the dawn of civilization through 2003, but that much information is now created every 2 days, and the pace is increasing.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[15],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/61"}],"collection":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=61"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/61/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1582,"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/61/revisions/1582"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=61"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=61"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=61"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"author":[{"id":1,"name":"scottsweb","url":"","description":"","link":"https://api.scott.ee/journal/author/scottsweb/","slug":"scottsweb","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1"}],"collection":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/users"}]}}],"wp:term":[[{"id":15,"link":"https://api.scott.ee/journal/category/sustainability/","name":"Sustainability","slug":"sustainability","taxonomy":"category","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/categories/15"}],"collection":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/categories"}],"about":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/taxonomies/category"}],"wp:post_type":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?categories=15"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}}],[]]}},{"id":259,"date":"2010-09-20T13:20:34","date_gmt":"2010-09-20T12:20:34","guid":{"rendered":"http://scott.cloudcontrol.me/?p=259"},"modified":"2017-12-15T21:47:31","modified_gmt":"2017-12-15T21:47:31","slug":"guidelines-for-green-web-design","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https://api.scott.ee/journal/guidelines-for-green-web-design/","title":{"rendered":"Guidelines for Green Web Design"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<blockquote><p>One crucial irony in this relatively new global concern for energy efficiency is that as broadband internet technologies improve speed of delivery, web designers and developers seem to be designing and building more cumbersome websites.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Make the Web a better place. <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/09/20/making-the-web-a-better-place-guidelines-for-green-web-design/\">smashingmagazine.com</a>.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"One crucial irony in this relatively new global concern for energy efficiency is that as broadband internet technologies improve speed of delivery, web designers and developers seem to be designing and building more cumbersome websites.

Free to own, free to modify. When I first started putting the project together (around five years ago now) I had already committed to the idea. The Internet relies on free and open source software and Pixie had to be part of that. I believed in it, and for the most part I still do.</p>\n<p>Without a doubt the project has been a success; on a personal level and for getting toggle off the ground. Pixie was the launch platform for our first year in business, it has been deployed by us on many websites and continues to work flawlessly. On top of that Pixie has been downloaded well over 25,000 times, translated into 18 languages and <a title=\"Pixie takes runner up spot as most promising open source CMS\" href=\"http://www.toggle.uk.com/journal/pixie-takes-runner-up-spot-as-most-promising-open-source-cms/\">awarded second place in the Packt open source CMS awards</a> (2009). Pixie has raised our profile and stood its ground against larger projects with more funding, more support and bigger communities.</p>\n<p>Its not all good news though and after a few months of reflection at the start of the year we decided it was time to consider stopping the project. My passion for developing the software started to fade towards the end of last year which coincided with a very difficult time for us. Our finances, jobs and business were on a knife edge.</p>\n<p>So at the start of April I listed Pixie for sale and so far I have been unsuccessful in finding a buyer. Pixie has not sold because it does not generate (easily measurable) revenue and potential buyers are faced with the challenge of monetising a project that requires time, development and support for the community. These are the same reasons it&rsquo;s difficult for a young business like ours to invest time on it and when you look at the numbers it makes for a very interesting story:</p>\n<h3>Help &amp; Support</h3>\n<p>There are 2824 messages in the forum &mdash; if we assume half of those are answers and half are questions that works out to be 1.9 questions per day for the lifespan of the project. Each reply has to be carefully considered and that adds up to a great deal of time. This does not include the personal emails that arrive in my inbox too. The real challenge is that for the project to grow it needs to be supported and realistically that support (at least at the start) needs to be free.</p>\n<h3>Code contributions</h3>\n<p>The number of downloads is fast approaching 30,000 &mdash; out of those people there are only three that I would class as core contributors. That is 0.01% of people giving back to the project and that is not good enough. There are lots of possibilities for why this is: perhaps I could have given the community better tools? maybe lots of people felt it was good enough already? I can only speculate as to why this might have happened but I wish the number was higher.</p>\n<h3>Financial contributions</h3>\n<p>In two years we have had three donations to the project (totalling &pound;70). This leads me to the conclusion that people do not appreciate the amount of time and effort it takes to run and develop such a project. We need to learn to value the things we do not pay for and/or lower our expectations. We have had some fairly insulting emails for taking our time when replying to support questions or because Pixie did not work as expected. Thankfully that has been a minority of people.</p>\n<h3>Advertising &amp; Referrals</h3>\n<p>To try and generate a small and steady income I&rsquo;ve looked at both advertising and partnerships. None have worked out very well. My first attempt was to use <a title=\"Google Adsense\" href=\"https://www.google.com/adsense/\">Google Adsense</a> across the site. After a few months the balance had made it to $30 and at that milestone Google shut our account. The money was gone and there is no appeal procedure to get it back. To this date I am unsure what happened. So I replaced those advert units with ones powered by <a title=\"Buy Sell Adverts\" href=\"http://buysellads.com/\">buysellads.com</a>. To date these adverts have generated $20 and I am unable to claim this money as it does not hit a threshold amount. That money might never make it to my account.</p>\n<p>I also formed a hosting partnership with a company called Arvixe. They pay $70 for each hosting referral I send to them and it started out well. Within a few weeks I had five registrations but I had to wait three months before being paid. As time went on those initial payments disappeared &mdash; apparently they cancelled their accounts before I was paid the referral. Nearly 12 months on and I have only ever had $140 from Arvixe. Referrals no longer show up despite people in the forums claiming they clicked through from the Pixie site.</p>\n<p>Last week I removed all advertising from the Pixie site. It is a real shame when open source projects have to turn to advertising to support themselves. I recently switched my laptop to <a title=\"Ubuntu Linux\" href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/\">Ubuntu</a> and have been searching around for open source software. Take a look at <a title=\"GIMP like Photoshop\" href=\"http://www.gimpshop.com/\">gimpshop.com</a> &mdash; the site is littered with adverts and you can tell by the language and layout that the developer is struggling. As a result the last release was released a very long time ago. I find it strange that we are happy to spend thousands of pounds on Adobe Creative Suite yet so reluctant to drop the developer of an alternative some beer money.</p>\n<p>Content creators across the web face this same problem every single day and thankfully a new service has appeared that tries to address the issue. It&rsquo;s called <a title=\"Flattr Micropayments\" href=\"https://flattr.com/\">Flattr</a> and I recommend grabbing an account. I have already created a <a title=\"Flattr Pixie\" href=\"https://flattr.com/thing/1202/Pixie-Open-Source-CMS\">Flattr button for Pixie</a> (to test the service) and at the end of the month I will be getting a small income from it, likely to be fractions of Euro. But it&rsquo;s a great start and beats having tacky adverts littered across the site. <a title=\"Flattr this post\" href=\"https://flattr.com/thing/6031/toggle-An-Open-Source-Education\">You can even Flattr this post</a>&hellip; after all, it took weeks to write (I started writing back in March!).</p>\n<h3>What next?</h3>\n<p>Collectively we need to get better at collaborating on open source projects. We all have a part to play and we must learn to appreciate the hard work that goes into the projects we take for granted every single day.</p>\n<p>Despite what it may read like I remain confident in open source. Open platforms will eventually win (see <a title=\"Google vs Apple\" href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/20/the-gloves-are-officially-off-google-vs-apple/\">Google vs Apple</a>) and the future we all want relies on this being the case. I have plans for some smaller projects that we are going to open source in future&hellip; actually most of my personal projects will either be open source or support open source projects.</p>\n<p>With regards to Pixie I feel I have taken the project as far as I can. I am now trying to decide what the next steps should be. The great thing about open source is that a project can live on regardless of what happens. If you have any ideas I would love to hear them.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"On 1st May 2008 I launched Pixie, an open source content management system.

A <a title=\"Bookmarklet information on Wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet\">bookmarklet</a> is like a normal browser bookmark but instead of taking you to the bookmarked page it interacts with and changes the current page using JavaScript.</p>\n<p>Pository decides how negative a page is and rates it accordingly. If the page fails then Pository recommends you read something a little happier. Speclative works in a similar way but looks for speculative language instead. Perhaps the title of this post makes sense now?</p>\n<h3>Where did the idea come from?</h3>\n<p>Last year we spent a great deal of time commuting. On a dreary three hour commute your eyes get drawn to the newspaper headlines on the many free newspapers. If you have ever been on a train at rush hour you will appreciate how easy it is to get sucked into articles being read by the person opposite. We were commuting whilst swine flu was a hot topic and the headlines read: <a title=\"Swine flu 'could kill up to 120m'\" href=\"http://www.metro.co.uk/news/635961-swine-flu-could-kill-up-to-120m\">Swine flu &lsquo;could kill up to 120m&rsquo;</a> and similar. It was clear to see that most of the articles were based on speculation and for the most part were written to spread misery and negativity. Could we do something about it?</p>\n<p><noscript><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1515\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/scottsweb.mystagingwebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/journal-newspaper.jpg?resize=900%2C503&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Newspaper clippings with highligted words\" width=\"900\" height=\"503\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/api.scott.ee/wp-content/uploads/journal-newspaper.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/api.scott.ee/wp-content/uploads/journal-newspaper.jpg?resize=250%2C140&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/api.scott.ee/wp-content/uploads/journal-newspaper.jpg?resize=768%2C429&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/api.scott.ee/wp-content/uploads/journal-newspaper.jpg?resize=700%2C391&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i2.wp.com/api.scott.ee/wp-content/uploads/journal-newspaper.jpg?resize=120%2C67&amp;ssl=1 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></noscript><div class=\"lazy\" data-width=\"900\" data-height=\"503\" style=\"--ratio:55.89%;\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1515\" src=\"\" alt=\"Newspaper clippings with highligted words\" width=\"900\" height=\"503\" srcset=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-src=\"https://i0.wp.com/scottsweb.mystagingwebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/journal-newspaper.jpg?resize=900%2C503&amp;ssl=1\" data-srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/api.scott.ee/wp-content/uploads/journal-newspaper.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/api.scott.ee/wp-content/uploads/journal-newspaper.jpg?resize=250%2C140&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/api.scott.ee/wp-content/uploads/journal-newspaper.jpg?resize=768%2C429&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/api.scott.ee/wp-content/uploads/journal-newspaper.jpg?resize=700%2C391&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i2.wp.com/api.scott.ee/wp-content/uploads/journal-newspaper.jpg?resize=120%2C67&amp;ssl=1 120w\"></div></p>\n<p>A few months into our commute we started to collect the newspapers discarded on the trains at the end of each day and look for patterns in language. Whilst we could not filter the stories in the real world we decided to take our battle to online where it is easier to analyse the data on a page. The idea was born.</p>\n<h3>How do they work?</h3>\n<p>As soon as you click on one of the bookmarkets the URL of the current page your viewing is sent to our web server. In a fraction of a second we retrieve the web page as plain text (this only works on publicly accessible pages). For Pository we have complied a list of positive (happy) and negative (sad) words and weighted them accordingly. We then count the occurrences of those words and from that we can score the page. Speclative works in a similar way except the keyword lists are different &mdash; based on fact and speculation. Once we have a score we can make a recommendation as to how speculative or negative the article is.</p>\n<p>The microsites are built using HTML5 and on the server side we are using <a title=\"PHP\" href=\"http://www.php.net/\">PHP5</a> with the excellent <a title=\"PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser\" href=\"http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net/\">PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser</a> library. The bookmarklets make use of <a title=\"The Write Less, Do More, JavaScript Library\" href=\"http://jquery.com/\">jQuery</a> and will auto update once you have them installed. The bookmarklets have been tested to work on all modern browsers except for Internet Explorer (support for IE will be available soon).</p>\n<h3>What comes next?</h3>\n<p>For now we are very interested in both the data we collect and the feedback we receive. Over time we hope to improve the scoring and weighting to reduce the number of &ldquo;unknown&rdquo; results.</p>\n<p>The data collected from the two bookmarklets will allow us to make generalisations about various news sources. Which websites provide happier news articles? Which websites write articles based on fact? Which websites write articles based on speculation? Once we have enough users of the service we will be able to answer these questions in real-time and eventually provide recommendations of other sites to visit: &ldquo;Is the current page you&rsquo;re reading too sad? Try this website that has written about a similar article in a positive way.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Once the databases have filled up we hope to provide interactive, real-time visualisations of the results. These will inform our research into Internet filtering. As the Internet swells with content the ability to quickly determine the usefulness of an article will be very important.</p>\n<p>Speclative and Pository were made to be good fun to use and they were certainly enjoyable to build. More details of how to install, use and provide feedback on the bookmarklets can be found at <a title=\"Pository - The negative news suppository (Bookmarklet)\" href=\"http://pository.scott.ee/\">postitory.scott.ee</a> and <a title=\"Speclative - The speculative news laxative (Bookmarklet)\" href=\"http://speclative.scott.ee/\">speclative.scott.ee</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Update 10/02/2013</strong>: The code for these projects is now <a href=\"https://github.com/scottsweb\">available on GitHub</a>.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Speclative and Pository are browser bookmarklets that determine if an article is worth reading or not.

Well you&rsquo;ve probably heard that this campaign started as a <a title=\"RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE FOR CHRISTMAS NO.1\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2228594104%22\">Facebook group</a> that quickly spread across other social networks and eventually into the media. The group set out to knock X-Factor off the top spot for this years Christmas number 1. I cannot comment much on X-Factor as I have never watched the show, however I did support the Rage campaign for a few different reasons.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Social media on WikiPedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media\">Social media</a> has been talked about a great deal in the last few years. Its thrown around as a buzzword and often over hyped in the process. Today though, it has shown its full potential. If everyone stands together on an issue we can make a big difference. In this instance the difference is relatively small (although <a title=\"Rage against the Machine to give proceeds to charity\" href=\"http://www.givecharitydonation.com/2009/12/20/rage-against-the-machine-to-give-proceeds-to-charity/\">Rage Against the Machine are donating the profits to charity</a>), but the model works and this campaign proves it. Social media puts people in control rather than <a title=\"Old Media on Wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_media\">old media</a>. This Christmas number 1 marks a tipping point in the balance that has always fallen heavily in the favour of old media. Year upon year we have been told what to buy at Christmas and we always oblige. The radio plays a handful of songs that the record labels want us to buy. This year we told the radio stations what to play.

We are free to say, share and create whatever takes our fancy. This leads to great ideas being shared across the planet in almost real time. Ideas that are <a title=\"The EyeWriter project is an ongoing collaborative research effort to empower people who are suffering from ALS with creative technologies.\" href=\"http://www.eyewriter.org/\">life changing</a>. Ideas that <a title=\"The LHC is an international research project based at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, where scientists, engineers and support staff from 111 nations are combining state-of-the-art science and engineering in one of the largest scientific experiments ever conducted.\" href=\"http://www.lhc.ac.uk/\">are fascinating</a>. Ideas that <a title=\"The Zeitgeist Movement is a grass roots campaign to unify the world through a common ideology based on the fundamentals of life and nature. \" href=\"http://www.zeitgeistmovie.com/\">are controversial</a>. Ideas that <a title=\"TED Talks: Ideas worth spreading\" href=\"http://www.ted.com/\">are worth spreading</a>.</p>\n<p><a title=\"The Digital Economy Bill on Wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Economy_Bill\">The Digital Economy Bill</a> is a complex beast. It is <a title=\"Full Digital Economy Bill\" href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldbills/001/10001.i-ii.html\">long</a>. It is boring. And the people responsible for drafting it like it that way. Within its many pages are clauses that will have detrimental effect to the Internet as we know it. The big show stopper is this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Section 17: Power to amend copyright provisions.</p>\n<p>The Secretary of State may by order amend Part 1 or this Part for the purpose of preventing or reducing the infringement of copyright by means of the internet, if it appears to the Secretary of State appropriate to do so having regard to technological developments that have occurred or are likely to occur&hellip;</p></blockquote>\n<p>I am no lawyer or politician, but here is my translation: If passed, the Digital Economy Bill will allow the Secretary of State to change copyright law at any time without requiring consent from other members of parliament. These changes can be made under the guise of &ldquo;reducing copyright infringement on the internet&rdquo;. That is a big deal.</p>\n<p>The Digital Economy Bill is shaped by industry insiders (record companies, copyright bodies) and has been drafted without public opinion. It exists to protect the interests of business and not people. Imagine for one second that laws were created in the same way Wikipedia articles are written. Everyone with Internet access (and everyone <a title=\"Finland: First Country To Make Broadband Access A Legal Right\" href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/10/14/applause-for-finland-first-country-to-make-broadband-access-a-legal-right/\">should have internet access</a>) could shape the bill and provide feedback. That is a powerful idea and would be an example of true democracy. The Digital Economy Bill is step in the wrong direction. We should be embracing new technology as a way of driving change. Instead we have big industries refusing to to create new business models and putting pressure on the Government as a result. Under this bill these businesses will pressure the Government into shaping copyright law in a way that only benefits them. Ouch.</p>\n<p>If I chose not support a new super web standard, I would probably go out of business. People would say &ldquo;you should have changed&rdquo;, &ldquo;its competition&rdquo; and &ldquo;that&rsquo;s business&rdquo;. They are right. Based on that same logic the record companies should either change or go out of business. Either way I think the artists (the ones who actually understand creativity) would be better off.</p>\n<p>Now is your chance to say and do something about it, we don&rsquo;t have long:</p>\n<ul><li>Step 1: <a title=\"Fellow Creative\" href=\"http://www.fellowcreative.com/2009/11/creative-freedom-campaign-digital-britain/\">Read Fellow Creative&rsquo;s post</a> on the issue.

It&rsquo;s known as <a title=\"Cloud computing\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing\">Cloud computing</a>. With the Cloud, our data is stored in highly efficient data centres that allow us to access our data from any internet connected device. Some services you may use that are built on this technology are:</p>\n<ul><li><a title=\"Google Mail\" href=\"http://www.google.com/mail\">Google Mail</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://docs.google.com/%20title=\">Google Documents</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"Spotify\" href=\"http://www.spotify.com\">Spotify</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"Dropbox\" href=\"http://www.dropbox.com\">Dropbox</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"MobileMe\" href=\"http://www.apple.com/mobileme/\">MobileMe</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"Amazon\" href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk\">Amazon.co.uk</a></li>\n</ul><p>Cloud computing has for the most part been seen as a greener way to serve and store data. It is all about efficiency. With a data centres built for one purpose we can achieve higher levels of energy efficiency and improved performance. The Cloud also benefits from scalability &mdash; a reason why it has become so popular among web start-ups.</p>\n<p>On the face of it this all sounds very positive but I cannot help feel we are making the same mistakes that we have made in the past. Lets compare Cloud computing to <a title=\"Wikipedia Monocropping\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocropping\">Monocropping</a>. With Monocropping we produce one single crop in abundance, that&rsquo;s our data centre. We then ship that crop from the fields, to a distribution centre and from there to the supermarket. That is the internet. We then head to the supermarket and bring it home, that&rsquo;s our ISP and home computer. So what is wrong with that?</p>\n<p>The problem is that its completely inefficient. Lets pick on Spotify. Rather than have a song stored locally on my computer I have to stream that song to me wherever I go. The bandwidth and computing power required to do that for every single song I own would soon add up. Rather than the data travelling from the hard drive of my machine to the speakers, it has to travel half way across the planet. Any efficiency gain made at the data centre is instantly lost with the constant shipment of 0&rsquo;s and 1&rsquo;s to and from the cloud to my machines. Multiply this by every internet user and I cannot help feel the cloud (at least for some applications) is a step in the wrong direction.</p>\n<p>All is not lost though. To improve efficiency of the Spotify example above we could all delete our digital music. This would instantly free up a huge amount of computing power and storage space. If this save of computing power could be put to good use (rather than end up as e-waste) we might just be onto something. Essentially we would have one library of digital music that the entire planet accesses on demand. I quite like that idea.</p>\n<p>The problem is, we love our data. We are married to it. We make backups of backups and get <a title=\"Cloud fails sidekick owners\" href=\"http://jkontherun.com/2009/10/10/sidekick-owners-get-bad-news-phone-data-is-gone-forever/\">extremely upset</a> when it gets deleted. Cheap technology allows us to hoard and save anything we wish &mdash; no matter how pointless or redundant. On this computer I have files that are over five years old. I never look at them and yet I am compelled to keep hold of them (and back them up).</p>\n<p>These questions need to be considered before we rush ahead at the rate technology carries us. Before every major technology shift we must ask if our <a title=\"Blog Action Day 2009\" href=\"http://www.blogactionday.org/\">climate and environment</a> can sustain it.
